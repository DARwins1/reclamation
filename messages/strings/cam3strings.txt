/* Mission Briefing */
L1_BMSG1		_("Greetings Commander. I am Edmund Clayde, former General of the North American Armed Forces, and I am the overseer of this operation.")
L1_BMSG2		_("You have been sent here today to lay the foundation for our reclamation of these blasted lands.")
L1_BMSG3		_("In order to achieve our goal, we must first establish our base of operations.")
L1_BMSG4		_("Recovered documents evidence the existance of a Pre-Collapse NASDA site located south of your position.")
L1_BMSG5		_("This site is believed to house nuclear weapons, making securing it our first priority.")
L1_BMSG6		_("Find this site, and establish our base there. You may need to use your weapons to clear a path through the trees.")
/* Wall Message */
L1_WALLMSG1		_("You're close now Commander, this appears to be the base's eastern wall.")
L1_WALLMSG2		_("Use your weapons to bring it down, and then get inside.")
/* Base Message */
L1_BASEMSG1		_("Well done Commander. I'm sure the Council will be pleased to know of our success.")
L1_BASEMSG2		_("I've sent a transport with trucks to your position. Use them to get this base up and running.")
L1_BASEMSG3		_("Make sure to construct a generator and investigate that research facility for anything useful.")
/* Scavenger Message */
L1_SCAVMSG1		_("After analysis of the missile silos, my technicians have confirmed that there are nuclear warheads present.")
L1_SCAVMSG2		_("We're picking up radio transmissions around your area. Most likely from scavengers around the NASDA site.")
L1_SCAVMSG3		_("If their loud radio chatter is anything to go by, then they're too busy fighting eachother to notice us yet.")
L1_SCAVMSG4		_("Commander, I'm ordering you to clear them out in order to ensure the safety of this site.")
L1_SCAVMSG5		_("Regardless of how you feel about diplomacy, this site is too important to negotiate over with the local gangs.")
/* Town Message */
L1_TOWNMSG1		_("See how this small river town's been torn apart by these warring gangs?")
L1_TOWNMSG2		_("If we succeed in our goal, we can bring an end to all this chaos.")
L1_TOWNMSG3		_("We will build a new world, a better world.")
L1_TOWNMSG4		_("But these scavengers only serve to stand in our way...")
/* Player Detection Message */
L1_DETMSG1		_("Commander, monitoring of scavenger radio chatter shows that they're aware of your presence, and are preparing to retaliate.")
L1_DETMSG2		_("Be ready to defend our base.")
L1_DETMSG3		_("Do not allow them to compromise the mission!")

/* L2S Hostages (Setup) */
/* Mission Briefing */
L2_BMSG1		_("Congratulations on securing our new base, Commander.")
L2_BMSG2		_("The Council has reviewed the report of your success and are pleased with the establishment of our base of operations.")
L2_BMSG3		_("Yet they showed great dissatisfaction that you 'violently engaged the local population', at my order.")
L2_BMSG4		_("But what other option is there, when the stakes are as great as these?")
L2_BMSG5		_("Nonetheless, I have a new objective for you.")
L2_BMSG6		_("Now that we have a suitable base of operations, the Council has determined that we are to secure a Pre-Collapse bio-engineering laboratory located somewhere in this sector.")
L2_BMSG7		_("Now, since this facility was top-secret, even among high ranking officials like myself, we have been unable to determine its exact location.")
L2_BMSG8		_("We have identified some individuals who have the information we need, but when we attempted to reach out to them, they were captured by scavengers.")
L2_BMSG9		_("They are now being held hostage by scavengers nearby.")
L2_BMSG10		_("Commander, take a transport and free those contacts using whatever means nessesary. Reinforcements will be available for this mission.")

/* L2 Hostages */
/* Scavenger Message 1 */
L2_SCAVMSG1		_("These scavengers are proving to be more than a nuisance.")
L2_SCAVMSG2		_("But the more they stand in the way of our goals, the more destruction we shall cause them.")
L2_SCAVMSG3		_("Go on, Commander.")
/* Scavenger Message 2 */
L2_SCAV2MSG1	_("When you've finished your work out there I'll have some extra questions for our contacts.")
L2_SCAV2MSG2	_("These scavengers seem to have a particular interest in them, which may mean they're after the same goal.")
L2_SCAV2MSG3	_("You've proved yourself quite capable, Commander. I am confident that you are more than able to handle whatever these hooligans can throw at us.")

/* L3 Suprise Attack */
/* Mission Briefing */
L3_BMSG1		_("Congratulations once again Commander, you've saved our civilian contacts.") 
L3_BMSG2		_("With their help, the Council has been able to pinpoint the location of the research facility we're looking for.")
L3_BMSG3		_("But they also had some ill news: according to the rescued civilians, the scavengers you've been fighting are searching for this same facility.")
L3_BMSG4		_("It is unknown if they have discovered its location yet. If the Council's understanding of this facility's purpose is correct, we must prevent the scavengers from finding it.")
L3_BMSG5		_("Furthermore, the Council has once again sought to condemn our methods of victory, fearing that 'our continuing aggression may prompt retaliation' from the local gangs.")
L3_BMSG6		_("But let me be clear, this operation is under my directive. And as long as we continue to succeed in our goals, I see no reason for us to not use the most effective methods at our disposal.")
L3_BMSG7		_("Prepare your forces for transport, we are going after that research facility.")
/* Suprise Attack Message */
L3_ATTMSG1		_("Commander, we're detecting a large scavenger attack coming in from the south.") 
L3_ATTMSG2		_("Repulse this attack immeadiately.") 
L3_ATTMSG3		_("We cannot afford to lose this site!") 
/* 'Now Go Kill Everything' Message */
L3_KILLMSG1		_("Helicopters? Perhaps I have truly underestimated the ingenuity of these scavengers after all...") 
L3_KILLMSG2		_("But we've come too far to be outplayed now.") 
L3_KILLMSG3		_("Commander, I'm overriding your previous objective. That research facility can wait.") 
L3_KILLMSG4		_("Make your way south, and eradicate those scavengers. Wipe out anything that gets in your way.") 

/* L4S Biological Research (Setup) */
/* Mission Briefing */
L4_BMSG1		_("Extraordinary work Commander, I knew I could count on you.") 
L4_BMSG2		_("I have not submitted a report to the Council about this... reprisal by the scavengers.")
L4_BMSG3		_("The way I see it, if the Council is so adamant on their objections to how I conduct my operations, then they don't need to know the details of said operations.")
L4_BMSG4		_("I will submit a report when you've secured the research facility. Go and send your forces now.")
L4_BMSG5		_("If the little intel we have about this site is even close to accurate, we cannot let these scavengers get there first.")

/* L4 Biological Research */
/* Ominous Message */
L4_WARNMSG1		_("Damnation! Those scavengers are already here.") 
L4_WARNMSG2		_("Clear them out and advance towards the research facility.")
L4_WARNMSG3		_("With any luck, we may still have enough time to stop them.")
/* Ambush Message */
L4_AMBUSHMSG1	_("Heads up Commander, I'm detecting a large amount of movement approaching your position.")
/* `Go Break Stuff` Message */
L4_KILLMSG1		_("I'm looking through my feed data, and I have a hard time believing what I'm seeing. So I will give you a new, clear objective.")
L4_KILLMSG2		_("Commander, destroy that research facility and destroy anyone or anything that stands in your way.")
L4_KILLMSG3		_("Lockdown this entire area. Don't let anything here survive, scavenger or otherwise.")

/* L5S Town Purge (Setup) */
/* Mission Briefing */
L5_BMSG1		_("These have been a troubling turn of events, to say the least.") 
L5_BMSG2		_("That laboratory must have been designing some sort of bio-weapon. Some sort of virus or parasite that's turning those scavengers into mindless swarms.") 
L5_BMSG3		_("And now that plague is free. Monitoring of scavenger radio waves show that they're in a state of panic.") 
L5_BMSG4		_("If the Council were to learn of our failure to reach the facility in time, of your failure to contain this outbreak...") 
L5_BMSG5		_("Commander, from now on we will be continuing this operation independent of the Council's 'oversight'. I will be the one giving every order going forward.") 
L5_BMSG6		_("I don't want you or any of your men to have any contact with the Council. For the success of this operation, they cannot know what is happening here.") 
L5_BMSG7		_("Your primary objective now is to curtail this infestation, and to crush anything that stands in the way of us establishing our hold.") 
L5_BMSG8		_("There is an old industrial town nearby. Scavenger radio chatter suggests it is under attack by the infested.") 
L5_BMSG9		_("Take your forces there and purge the town. We must move swiftly and hit hard in order to succeed.") 

/* L5 Town Purge */
/* Scav Base Message */
L5_SCAVMSG1		_("Commander, continue forward and eradicate that scavenger base.") 
L5_SCAVMSG2		_("Infested or not, they still pose a threat to our cause, and as such must be rooted out.") 
L5_SCAVMSG3		_("If we are to succeed, we cannot allow any loose ends to remain.") 

/* L6S AA Hunter (Setup) */
/* Mission Briefing */
L6_BMSG1		_("Hello Commander, I am a representative of the Council.") 
L6_BMSG2		_("General Clayde has informed us about the situation, and about the events that have transpired since your last report.") 
L6_BMSG3		_("...") 
L6_BMSG4		_("As per direction of the Council, I will be acting as your overseer going forward with this operation.") 
L6_BMSG5		_("We have constructed a plan to evacuate this area of all survivors via moving them to a nearby secure location.") 
L6_BMSG6		_("Unfortunately, we have detected multiple anti-air batteries located along the fastest route between our base and the haven.") 
L6_BMSG7		_("If we are to succeed in this evacuation effort, these emplacements must be taken offline.") 
L6_BMSG8		_("This area has also served as a major stronghold for the local scavengers. Based on your previous actions, reaching any sort of diplomatic solution with these holdouts seems impossible.") 
L6_BMSG9		_("Good luck, Commander. Countless lives are now depending on your success.") 

/* L6 AA Hunter */
/* Infested Wave Warning Message */
L6_INFESMSG1	_("Commander be advised: we have received reports that large numbers of infested amassing just outside your area of operation.") 
L6_INFESMSG2	_("Judging by the large scavenger presence here, the infested are most likely preparing to overrun whatever is left of them.") 
L6_INFESMSG3	_("Please work quickly, as we are unsure of when they will begin to descend upon this position.")  
/* Infested Wave Imminent Message */
L6_WAVEMSG1		_("Commander, the infested are converging towards your location.") 
L6_WAVEMSG2		_("The incoming infested are to numerous too count; we are ordering an immediate retreat to LZ for extraction.") 
L6_WAVEMSG3		_("There's no feasible way for your forces to hold out there for long.") 
/* 'You Are Taking Too Long' Message */
L6_SCOLDMSG1	_("What are you still doing out there?!") 
L6_SCOLDMSG2	_("Are you searching for more glory? More bloodshed by combat?") 
L6_SCOLDMSG3	_("By delaying your orders to retreat, you are only putting yourself and your own troops at risk.") 
L6_SCOLDMSG4	_("Regroup at the LZ for evac, unless you'd rather we call off the transports and leave you behind.") 

/* L7 Final Defensive */
/* Mission Briefing */
L7_BMSG1		_("Welcome back, Commander. We are pleased with your success in taking those AA guns offline.") 
L7_BMSG2		_("However, even without them impeding our progress, our evacuation is still behind schedule.")
L7_BMSG3		_("We're still getting groups of stragglers, and the infested are closing in on our position at this very moment.") 
L7_BMSG4		_("We don't have much time left. You must defend the base while we finish the evacuation.") 
L7_BMSG5		_("Once all civilians and critical personnel are away, we'll have the transports come back for you and your forces.") 
L7_BMSG6		_("This is it Commander. Good luck.") 
/* Detonation Message */
L7_DETMSG1		_("Greetings Commander. This is General Clayde.")
L7_DETMSG2		_("The evacuation was a success, the final transports have taken off...")
L7_DETMSG3		_("... but they're not coming back for you.")
L7_DETMSG4		_("When I gave my report to the Council, I told them that you were unhinged.")
L7_DETMSG5		_("That you went out of your way to seek out the death and destruction of anyone who stood in your way.")
L7_DETMSG6		_("That the only reason for the scavengers' hostility, the reason that this infection was released, was due to your own bloodthirstiness and negligence of duty.")
L7_DETMSG7		_("And you know what happened?")
L7_DETMSG8		_("They believed it. All of it.")
L7_DETMSG9		_("Who could blame them? Isn't it much simpler to cast the blame on a no-name Commander stepping out of line than your highest ranking general?")
L7_DETMSG10		_("They see you now as a liability. Nothing more than a threat to our goals.")
L7_DETMSG11		_("No less of a threat than this infestation itself.")
L7_DETMSG12		_("...")
L7_DETMSG13		_("But you still serve one crucial purpose: Bait.")
L7_DETMSG14		_("The infested are approaching your base from every direction.")
L7_DETMSG15		_("In just over 10 minutes, the nuclear warheads stored in those silos are set to detonate.")
L7_DETMSG16		_("And in a single blast, both you and the infested will all be reduced to dust.")
L7_DETMSG17		_("Two birds with one radioactive stone.")
L7_DETMSG18		_("I will be remembered as the one who triumphed over hostile scavenger clans, a rampaging infection, and a treacherous Commander.")
L7_DETMSG19		_("As for you?")
L7_DETMSG20		_("You only be remembered merely as another obstacle overcame by the great General Edmund Clayde.")
L7_DETMSG21		_("Goodbye, Commander.")
