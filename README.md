Warzone 2100 Reclamation Mod
----------------------------
This mod adds an entirely custom campaign to the game. The campaign can feasibly takes place within the Warzone 2100 universe, but has it's own self-contained story. 

------------------
Spoiler Warning!!!
------------------
It is HIGHLY recommended that you play through the mod's campaign fully at least once before going through the mod's files, or else you might tarnish part of the experience for yourself (This README is spoiler free though!). But if you've already beaten the mod, then feel free to look around!

------------
Installation
------------
After downloading the Reclamation.wz file, place it into your `mods/autoload` folder in your main warzone directory (If you can't find the main directory, click "Open Configuration Directory" in the Options menu). After moving Reclamation.wz into the autoload folder, launch the game. If you see "Mod: Reclamation.wz" in the upper left of the main menu, then you've probably done it correctly. To play without the mod, simply move the Reclamation.wz file out of the `autoload` folder.

--------------------
Playing With The Mod
--------------------
To get started, simply click Single Player -> New Campaign -> Reclamation Campaign. Also feel free to change your player color and difficulty in Options -> Game Options. Also turning on Fog in Options -> Graphics Options is recommended because it looks cool.
This mod DOES NOT support Skirmish/Multiplayer games! Please disable the mod before trying to play those or else your computer will explode or something.

With that out of the way, I hope you will enjoy / have enjoyed the Reclamation mod!
