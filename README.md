# Reclamation
----------------------------
Warzone 2100 Reclamation Mod
----------------------------
This mod adds an entirely custom campaign to the game. The campaign can feasibly take place within the Warzone 2100 universe, but has its own self-contained story. 

------------------
Spoiler Warning!!!
------------------
It is HIGHLY recommended that you play through the mod's campaign fully at least once before going through the mod's files, or else you might tarnish part of the experience for yourself (This README is spoiler free though!). But if you've already beaten the mod, then feel free to look around!

------------
Installation
------------
After downloading the Reclamation.wz file, place it into your `mods/campaign` folder in your main warzone directory (If you can't find the main directory, click "Open Configuration Directory" in the Options menu). After moving Reclamation.wz into the campaign folder, launch the game. Go to Single Player > New Campaign, and Reclamation should now show up under "Additional Campaigns".

--------------------
Playing With The Mod
--------------------

To get started, simply click Single Player -> New Campaign -> Reclamation. Select your difficulty as desired. Also feel free to change your player color in Options -> Game Options. Also turning on Fog in Options -> Graphics Options is recommended because it looks cool.

With that out of the way, I hope you will enjoy / have enjoyed the Reclamation mod!
